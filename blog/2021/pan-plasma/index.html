Nicholas, 29/06/2021</p><p>TLDR: The MCF and plasma physics community should copy the <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" href="https://pangeo.io/" class="">Pangeo project</a> and its (xarray + dask-based) software ecosystem, because geosciences have already solved many of the software problems we still struggle with.</p><h3 id="problems-to-solve" class="relative group"><span class="heading-text">Problems to solve</span><a class="no-underline text-inherit hover:text-inherit inline-block w-0 px-0 translate-x-[10px] font-normal select-none transition-opacity opacity-0 focus:opacity-100 group-hover:opacity-70" href="#problems-to-solve" title="Link to this Section" aria-label="Link to this Section">¶</a></h3><p>My experience of software practices in fusion research has been that there are some common and widespread problems. In particular:</p><ul><li><strong>Code is not open or shared.</strong> Whilst there are notable exceptions, the typical workflow of a fusion research group right now involves simulation or diagnostic processing code that is closed-source, sometimes requires a licence (for IDL or MatLab), and is not designed to be reusable or composable for other researchers. This increases the chance of bugs, massively inhibits collaboration, and prevents reproducibility.</li><li><strong>Re-inventing the wheel regularly</strong> is another inevitable result of not sharing tools. Even different groups who use the same simulation code often have different data loading and analysis scripts. Clear opportunities for standardization are not taken - for example the ubiquitous edge simulation code SOLPS has no good set of standard analysis tools. This is to say nothing of the myriad equilibrium solving codes, field-line tracers, and diverted geometry plotting scripts.</li><li><strong>Not taking advantage of existing solutions</strong> from other domains. A lot of what we do already has well-developed tools, and other fields have already faced and overcome many software challenges that we still struggle with. There is perhaps a bit of a cultural issue at play where we think fusion is especially hard or different somehow, e.g. “the science and engineering challenges are novel and unprecedentedly complicated, so we need to use totally bespoke software tools”. This does not follow - in reality the majority of fusion research involves rather similar modelling and analysis tasks to other fields of science. Most of us still merely need to load gridded numerical data from simulations or experiment, run some pretty standard analysis functions on it, and then visualize the results. (The one exception <em>might</em> be in the degree of complexity of integrated modelling, but that effort would still benefit from these recommendations.)</li><li><strong>Outdated</strong> analysis scripts in IDL are commonplace, and even groups that use python aren’t necessarily using the external libraries that they should be.</li><li><strong>Doesn’t scale</strong>. Using older tools, downloading to local filesystems, and not standardizing methods of parallel data analysis will uneccesarily limit a lot of our workflows in size. This will impact our science: new simlations and diagnostics are already producing ever-larger datasets and working at scale (not to mention for training Machine Learning models) needs to be an explicit priority.</li></ul><h3 id="geosciences-have-already-solved-these" class="relative group"><span class="heading-text">Geosciences have already solved these!</span><a class="no-underline text-inherit hover:text-inherit inline-block w-0 px-0 translate-x-[10px] font-normal select-none transition-opacity opacity-0 focus:opacity-100 group-hover:opacity-70" href="#geosciences-have-already-solved-these" title="Link to this Section" aria-label="Link to this Section">¶</a></h3><p>It turns out that another field of science has already found a good solution to many of these problems: the <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" href="https://pangeo.io/" class="">Pangeo project</a> for Big Data Geoscience.</p><p>Whilst most if not all fields of science could benefit from efforts like Pangeo, the crossover is especially clear for fusion research, as geoscientists and plasma physicists have extremely similar problems computationally. Both fields deal primarily with datasets which are:</p><ul><li>Multidimensional (often fluid turbulent),</li><li>Large (bigger than local RAM),</li><li>On regular but warped grids,</li><li>Often pulled from central servers,</li><li>From multiple sources but with common structure (e.g. experimental and simulation data for the same device).</li></ul><p>Pangeo is both a set of packages and a community, which aims to solve the problems I mentioned earlier.</p><ul><li><strong>Open</strong> code and data encourages collaboration, with all packages available on github, many important datasets available online, and technical discussions happening publicly via github issues or the community’s <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" href="https://discourse.pangeo.io/" class="">discourse forum</a>.</li><li><strong>Shared tools</strong> are the aim, via creating and advertising tools for the community. Clear entry points for new packages mean that only a small compatibility layer is required in order to plug into and benefit the whole ecosystem.</li><li><strong>Uses domain-agnostic tools</strong> where possible, enabled by a conscious splitting of responsibility. For example the xarray package provides powerful labelled multidimensional data structures for manipulation by downstream libraries, but does not require the data stored to be geospatial or even necessarily scientific. Instead each layer of functionality is separated by a common API, allowing packages to be swapped out. This also allows tool sharing across disciplines, massively disributing the development effort.</li><li><strong>Modern</strong> tools and software practices are the norm, with well-tested and documented code throughout the stack. Pangeo’s main stack is written in Python, but there is no reason why a similar ecosystem could not work in another open-source language like Julia for example.</li><li><strong>Scalable</strong> data analysis is enabled through the dask library, which seamlessly integrates with xarray to parallelize data analysis with little or no extra effort for the user. Pangeo also provides a cloud platform for users to run data analysis tasks, which works best with cloud-optimized file formats such as <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" href="https://zarr.readthedocs.io/en/stable/" class="">Zarr</a>. <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" href="https://medium.com/pangeo/the-case-for-cloud-in-science-3f98f6538a33" class="">Moving scientific work to the Cloud</a> is potentially a paradigm shift in how we think about scientific data analysis challenges.</li></ul><h3 id="how-would-this-fit-in-with-other-fusion-software-efforts" class="relative group"><span class="heading-text">How would this fit in with other fusion software efforts?</span><a class="no-underline text-inherit hover:text-inherit inline-block w-0 px-0 translate-x-[10px] font-normal select-none transition-opacity opacity-0 focus:opacity-100 group-hover:opacity-70" href="#how-would-this-fit-in-with-other-fusion-software-efforts" title="Link to this Section" aria-label="Link to this Section">¶</a></h3><p>Whilst the majority of fusion researchers are using scattered codebases, there are at least three significant efforts to improve the software experience for plasma physicists. Each of these would benefit from a pangeo-like ecosystem.</p><ul><li><strong>OMFIT</strong> is a simulation and analysis workflow tool, essentially providing a huge and extensible GUI on top of existing simulation codes. It already uses xarray under the hood for some parts, and so should aim to sit atop a pangeo-like set of packages. Therefore improvements in the standardization and interoperability of underlying packages would improve the reliability, maintainability, and power of OMFIT itself, by allowing OMFIT developers and the rest of the (non-OMFIT-using) community to benefit from each other’s work.</li><li><strong>IMAS</strong> is an extremly powerful and complex software project at ITER. Like OMFIT, IMAS would benefit from being able to internally rely upon modular packages which are also in use in the wider community.</li><li><strong>PlasmaPy</strong> is the closest effort to this proposal already existing, and is huge step in the right direction. A pangeo-like ecosystem differs in the emphasis on modularity and interoperability between separate packages, treating xarray &amp; dask as key packages which together enable analysis at scale, and taking care to keep as much functionality as domain-agnostic as possible.</li></ul><h3 id="specific-needs-and-vision" class="relative group"><span class="heading-text">Specific needs and vision</span><a class="no-underline text-inherit hover:text-inherit inline-block w-0 px-0 translate-x-[10px] font-normal select-none transition-opacity opacity-0 focus:opacity-100 group-hover:opacity-70" href="#specific-needs-and-vision" title="Link to this Section" aria-label="Link to this Section">¶</a></h3><p>Certain packages and specifications would be particularly useful within a plasma ecosystem. Each of these suggestions either currently does not exist, or exists in multiple places unneccesarily, without a standardized interface. Several of these suggestions have clear analogies to existing geoscience libraries used in Pangeo.</p><ul><li><strong>A single tokamak data model</strong> for multidimensional data. Xarray provides a powerful and general data structure, but some agreement about how to encode tokamak-specific features may be required so that downstream packages know what to expect. This can be taken  further into grid-aware analysis, like <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" href="https://github.com/xgcm/xgcm" class="">xGCM</a> does for Global Circulation Models.</li><li><strong>Shared plasma metadata conventions</strong> about grids, variables and units, similar to the <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" href="https://cfconventions.org/" class="">Climate and Forecast Metadata Conventions</a> designed for netCDF files, would ameliorate the challenge of integrated analysis of output from a very large number of plasma simulation codes and datasets. Shared conventions would vastly improve interoperability, reproducibility, and accuracy. Xarray can store arbitrary metadata in the attributes of data objects, and decoding of file metadata can be done upon opening.</li><li><strong>Tokamak plotting</strong> of various geometries consuming these data structures, dealing with the tricky projections and topologies in one place, just like <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" href="https://github.com/SciTools/cartopy" class="">Cartopy</a> does for map projections of the Earth. Careful separation of plotting from projection, topology, and features (e.g. separatrices and walls) would avoid locking users into a single plotting library.

Building an <code>xarray.Dataset</code> with such a <code>TokamakIndex</code> would allow for any type of indexing we liked.</li><li><strong>Common analysis tools</strong>. Every fusion physicist has an implementation of certain common tasks, such as equilibrium handling, timeseries analysis, common diagnostic instrument analysis, and field-line tracing.

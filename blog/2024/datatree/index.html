Unfortunately whilst we’ve been lucky to <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" href="https://chanzuckerberg.com/eoss/proposals/xarray-multidimensional-labeled-arrays-and-datasets-in-python/" class="">receive CZI funding before</a>, on this occasion we didn’t win money to work on the datatree idea.</p><p>In the absence of dedicated funding for datatree, Tom then used some time whilst at the <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" href="https://ocean-transport.github.io/cds_lab.html" class="">Climate Data Science Lab</a> at Columbia University to take a initial stab at the design in August 2021 - writing the first implementation on an overnight Amtrak! This simple prototype was released as a separate package in the <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" href="https://github.com/xarray-contrib/datatree" class=""><code>xarray-contrib/datatree</code> repository</a>, and steadily gained a small community of intrepid users. It was driven partly by the use case of <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" href="https://medium.com/pangeo/easy-ipcc-part-1-multi-model-datatree-469b87cf9114" class="">climate model intercomparison datasets</a>.</p><p>A separate repository was chosen for speed of iteration, and to be able to more easily <a href="https://github.com/xarray-contrib/datatree/blob/7ba05880c37f2371b5174f6e8dcfae31248fe19f/README.md#development-roadmap" class="italic" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" data-state="closed">make changes</a> without worrying as much about <a href="https://github.com/pydata/xarray/issues/9854" class="italic" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" data-state="closed">backwards compatibility</a> as code in xarray’s main repo does. However the separate repo meant that the prototype <code>datatree</code> library was not fully integrated with xarray’s main codebase, limiting possible features and requiring fragile dependencies on private xarray internals.</p><p>The prototype then sat there for 2 years, until the NASA ESDIS team approached the xarray core team in August 2023. ESDIS devs wanted the ability to work with entire hierarchical files, and had experimented with the prototype version of datatree, but they wanted datatree functionality to be migrated upstream into xarray’s main repository so there would be more guarantees of long-term API stability and support.</p><p>Amazingly NASA were able to offer the time of 3 engineers: Owen (NASA EOSDIS Evolution and Development 3 (EED-3) contract), Matt (NASA National Snow and Ice Data Center Distributed Active Archive Center (NSIDC)), and Eni (Goddard Earth Sciences Data and Information Services Center (GES DISC)). So starting in late 2023 the NASA trio worked on migrating the prototype datatree into xarray upstream, with regular supervision from Tom, Justus, and Stephan (existing xarray core team).</p><p>This second stage of development allowed us to reduce the bus factor on the datatree code, sanity check the original approach, and it gave us a chance to make some significant improvements to the design without backwards-compatibility concerns (for example enabling the <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" href="https://docs.xarray.dev/en/stable/user-guide/hierarchical-data.html#alignment-and-coordinate-inheritance" class="">new “coordinate inheritance” feature</a>).</p><h2 id="lessons-for-future-collaborations" class="relative group"><span class="heading-text">Lessons for future collaborations</span><a class="no-underline text-inherit hover:text-inherit inline-block w-0 px-0 translate-x-[10px] font-normal select-none transition-opacity opacity-0 focus:opacity-100 group-hover:opacity-70" href="#lessons-for-future-collaborations" title="Link to this Section" aria-label="Link to this Section">¶</a></h2><p>This development story is different from the more typical scientific grant funding model - how did that work out for us?</p><p>The scientific grant model for funding software expects you to present a full idea in a proposal, wait 6-12 months to hopefully get funding for it, then implement the whole thing during the grant period. In contrast datatree evolved over a gradual process of moving from ideas to hacky prototype to robust implementation, with big time gaps for user feedback and experimentation. The migration was completed by developer-users who actually wanted the feature, rather than grant awardees working in service of a separate and maybe-only-theoretical userbase.</p><p>Overall while the migration effort took longer than anticipated we think it worked out quite well!</p><h3 id="pros" class="relative group"><span class="heading-text">Pros</span><a class="no-underline text-inherit hover:text-inherit inline-block w-0 px-0 translate-x-[10px] font-normal select-none transition-opacity opacity-0 focus:opacity-100 group-hover:opacity-70" href="#pros" title="Link to this Section" aria-label="Link to this Section">¶</a></h3><ul><li><strong>Zero overhead</strong> - the existing xarray team did not to have to write a proposal to get developer time, and there was literally zero paperwork inflicted (on them at least).</li><li><strong>Certainty of funding</strong> - writing grant proposals is a lottery, so the time invested up front doesn’t even come with any certainty of funding. Collaborating with another org has a much higher chance of actually leading to more money being available for developer time.</li><li><strong>Time efficient</strong> - an xarray core dev spending 10% of their time advising someone who is less familiar with the codebase but has more time is an efficient use of relative expertise.</li><li><strong>Bus factor</strong> - the new contributors reduced the bus factor on the datatree code dramatically.</li><li><strong>User-driven Development</strong> - it makes sense to have actual interested user communities involved in development.</li><li><strong>Stakeholder representation</strong> - after officially adding Owen, Matt and Eni to the <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" href="https://xarray.dev/team" class="">xarray core team</a>, the NASA ESDIS project has some direct representation in, insider understanding of, and stake in continuing to support the xarray project.</li></ul><h3 id="cons" class="relative group"><span class="heading-text">Cons</span><a class="no-underline text-inherit hover:text-inherit inline-block w-0 px-0 translate-x-[10px] font-normal select-none transition-opacity opacity-0 focus:opacity-100 group-hover:opacity-70" href="#cons" title="Link to this Section" aria-label="Link to this Section">¶</a></h3><ul><li><strong>Not everyone got direct funding</strong> - It’s less ideal that Tom, Justus, and Stephan didn’t get direct funding for their supervisory work. In future it might be better to have one of the paid people at the contributing org already be a core xarray team member, or perhaps find some way to pay them as a consultant.</li><li><strong>Tricky to accurately scope</strong> - The duration of required work was tricky to estimate in advance, and we didn’t want to “just ship it”. We hold the xarray project to high standards and backwards compatibility promises so we want to ensure that any publicly released features don’t compromise on quality.</li></ul><p>This contributing model is more similar to how open-source software has historically been supported by industry, but perhaps because xarray is primarily developed and used by the scientific community we tend to default to more grant-based funding models.</p><p>Overall we think this type of collaboration could work again in future!

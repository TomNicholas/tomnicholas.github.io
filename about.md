# About me

I'm a physicist turned software engineer.

I work on projects that make it easier to analyse and share massive scientific datasets. I strongly feel that progress in most fields of computational science is bottlenecked by how uneccessarily hard that is right now. There are [crucial missing pieces](./blog/2025/science-needs-a-social-network.md) of global scientific infrastructure.

## What I do

**Open Source Software and Communities for Science**
```

I contribute to a number of open-source software projects that support this aim, often as part of the [Pangeo Community](https://pangeo.io/).

A few projects I'm particularly proud of or excited about, and my role in them:

- [Xarray](https://xarray.dev/) - N-D labeled arrays and datasets in Python (core maintainer).
- [VirtualiZarr](https://github.com/zarr-developers/VirtualiZarr) - Cloud-Optimizes your Scientific Data as Virtual Zarr stores, using Xarray syntax (original author and lead developer).
- [Cubed](https://cubed-dev.github.io/cubed/) - Scalable array processing with bounded memory (cheerleader, and author of the [Cubed-Xarray integration](https://cubed-dev.github.io/cubed/examples/xarray.html)).
- [FROST](https://github.com/TomNicholas/FROST) - Federated registry of all scientific datasets (originator - I'm trying to make this a thing).

**Scientific Research Dilettante**
```

I have been involved with research projects in various fields, including:

- Nuclear Fusion Plasma Physics
- Physical Oceanography
- Ocean-based Carbon Dioxide Removal
- Hypersonic Aerothermodynamics
- Superconductivity

In every field I have felt the same kinds of pain around doing computational work, which motivates my software projects.

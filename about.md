# About me

I'm a physicist turned software engineer.

I work on projects that make it easier to analyse and share massive scientific datasets. I strongly feel that progress in most fields of computational science, including crucially Climate Science, are bottlenecked by how uneccessarily hard that is to do right now.

## What I do

```{div}

**Open Source Software and Communities for Science**
```
```{div}
:class: col-body-right

I contribute to a number of open-source software projects that support this aim, often as part of the [Pangeo Community](https://pangeo.io/).

A few projects I'm particularly proud of or excited about, and my role in them:

- [Xarray](https://xarray.dev/) - N-D labeled arrays and datasets in Python (core maintainer).
- [VirtualiZarr](https://github.com/zarr-developers/VirtualiZarr) - Cloud-Optimizes your Scientific Data as Virtual Zarr stores, using Xarray syntax (original author and lead developer).
- [Cubed](https://cubed-dev.github.io/cubed/) - Scalable array processing with bounded memory (cheerleader, and author of the [Cubed-Xarray integration](https://cubed-dev.github.io/cubed/examples/xarray.html)).
- [FROST](https://github.com/TomNicholas/FROST) - Federated registry of all scientific datasets (originator - I'm trying to make this a thing).

**Scientific Research Dilettante**

I have been involved with research projects in various fields, including:

- Nuclear Fusion Plasma Physics
- Physical Oceanography
- Ocean-based Carbon Dioxide Removal
- Hypersonic Aerothermodynamics
- Superconductivity

In every field I have felt the same kinds of pain around doing computational work, which motivates my software projects.

## About this website

This website is my fork of [Chris Holdgraf](https://chrisholdgraf.com/)'s experiment in hosting a personal website and blog via Sphinx extensions instead of using Jekyll. All the credit for how nice the website looks goes to him.

## A rough timeline

Below is a (somewhat experimental) rough timeline of what I've been up to over the past several years.

2020: **Co-Founded [2i2c](https://2i2c.org)**
^^^
2i2c is a non-profit organization that makes interactive computing environments more accessible to the research and education community. It supports the delpoyment of open infrastructure for this community, and also supports the open source communities underneath this infrastructure.

**2017** Joined the Jupyter Project
^^^
After finishing graduate school I began a Post-Doc with [Fernando Perez](http://fperez.org/), focusing my work around applying and developing the Jupyter ecosystem to support workflows in research and education. Here are a few of the main things I did during this time:
- Co-lead the [Binder Project](https://mybinder.org) for interactive, reproducible, sharable computational environments.
- Co-lead the [JupyterHub team](https://jupyterhub-team-compass.readthedocs.io/en/latest/team.html), which builds tools for deploying interactive computing environments on shared infrastructure.
- Served as "community architect" for the [Berkeley Data Science Education Program](https://data.berkeley.edu/dsep), which runs JupyterHubs on campus for education.
- Co-launched the [Jupyter Book project](https://jupyterbook.org), a tool for building books from collections of notebooks and markdown files.

**2011** Graduate school at Berkeley
^^^
My scientific training began as a neuroscientist, where I studied the ways that humans process speech and sound. I used computational models and machine learning to tie patterns of brain activity to spectral features of sound. In particular I focused on **speech in noise** to understand how our brain fills in missing details in auditory information.
